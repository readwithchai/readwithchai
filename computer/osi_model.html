    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #993300;"><strong>OSI Model</strong></span></h1>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #000080;">The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand how different networking protocols and technologies interact. It consists of seven layers, each responsible for specific functions in data communication. Here's an overview of each layer and its primary responsibilities:</span></p>
<ol style="text-align: justify;">
<li>
<p><strong>Physical Layer (Layer 1):</strong> This layer deals with the physical transmission of data over the network medium. It defines the electrical, mechanical, and timing aspects of the physical connection between devices. It includes specifications for cables, connectors, hubs, repeaters, and other hardware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data Link Layer (Layer 2):</strong> This layer is responsible for node-to-node communication, ensuring data is delivered error-free over the physical layer. It handles framing, addressing, error detection, and flow control. Ethernet switches and wireless access points operate at this layer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Network Layer (Layer 3):</strong> This layer manages routing and forwarding data packets between different networks. It determines the best path for data to travel from the source to the destination across interconnected networks. Routers function at this layer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transport Layer (Layer 4):</strong> This layer provides end-to-end communication between devices. It ensures that data packets are delivered reliably, accurately, and in the correct sequence. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are protocols operating at this layer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Session Layer (Layer 5):</strong> This layer establishes, manages, and terminates communication sessions between devices. It sets up, maintains, and synchronizes interactions, allowing data exchange and dialog control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Presentation Layer (Layer 6):</strong> This layer is responsible for data translation, encryption, and compression, ensuring that data sent by the application layer of one system can be read by the application layer of another system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Application Layer (Layer 7):</strong> This layer interacts with software applications that implement network communication services such as file transfers, email services, web browsing, and more. It provides an interface for users and application processes to access network services.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Each layer in the OSI model performs specific functions, and data is passed down through these layers on the sending device and passed up through these layers on the receiving device, each layer adding its own header or trailer information as needed for the data to traverse the network.</p>
